# Tic-Tac-Toe Multiplayer â€“ Client-Server Application

This project is a network-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It was developed collaboratively with classmates as part of a Distributed Systems course assignment.

## Overview

The application uses a client-server architecture:

- The **server** manages multiple simultaneous games.
- Each **client** allows a player to connect and play against another user via a graphical interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Files: `server.py` and `client.py`
- Local network connection (localhost)

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
python server.py

### 2. Start the Client

python client.py
